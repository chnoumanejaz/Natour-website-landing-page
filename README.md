<h2>About Sass 👍</h2>
<P>
  If you want to use Sass files then just use <code>npm install</code> in the working directory and you are good to go.

<P>
  If you want to just check the site then there is no need for the sass files just use: 
          <ul>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>css/style.css</li>
            <li>img/ (folder)</li>
  </ul>
  These 3 files are enough. ✌
